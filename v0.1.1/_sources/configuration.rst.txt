=============
Configuration
=============

``sphinx-multiversion`` reads your Sphinx :file:`conf.py` file for configuration.
As usual, you can also override certain options by using ``-D var=value`` on the command line.

This is what the default configuration looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    # Whitelist pattern for tags (set to None to ignore all tags)
    smv_tag_whitelist = r'^.*$'

    # Whitelist pattern for branches (set to None to ignore all branches)
    smv_branch_whitelist = r'^.*$'

    # Whitelist pattern for remotes (set to None to use local branches only)
    smv_remote_whitelist = None

    # Pattern for released versions
    smv_released_pattern = r'^tags/.*$'

    # Format for versioned output directories inside the build directory
    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.name}'

    # Determines whether remote or local git branches/tags are preferred if their output dirs conflict
    smv_prefer_remote_refs = False

You an override all of these values inside you :file:`conf.py`.

.. note::

    You can check which tags/branches are matched by running ``sphinx-multiversion`` with the ``--dump-metadata`` flag.


Tag/Branch/Remote whitelists
============================

Tags, Branches and Remotes are included by `Regular Expressions <python_regex_>`_.
Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    smv_tag_whitelist = r'^.*$'                   # Include all tags
    smv_tag_whitelist = r'^v\d+\.\d+$'            # Include tags like "v2.1"

    smv_branch_whitelist = r'^.*$'                # Include all branches
    smv_branch_whitelist = r'^(?!master).*$'      # Include all branches except "master"

    smv_remote_whitelist = None                   # Only use local branches
    smv_remote_whitelist = r'^.*$'                # Use branches from all remotes
    smv_remote_whitelist = r'^(origin|upstream)$' # Use branches from origin and upstream

.. note::

    To list values to match, you can use ``git branch``, ``git tag`` and ``git remote``.


Release Pattern
===============

A Regular Expression is used to determine if a version of the documentation has been released or if it's a development version.
To allow more flexibility, the regex is evaluated over the full refname.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    smv_released_pattern = r'^tags/.*$'           # Tags only
    smv_released_pattern = r'^heads/\d+\.\d+$'    # Branches like "2.1"
    smv_released_pattern = r'^(tags/.*|heads/\d+\.\d+)$'           # Branches like "2.1" and all tags
    smv_released_pattern = r'^(heads|remotes/[^/]+)/(?!:master).*$' # Everything except master branch

.. note::

    To list all refnames , you can use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git for-each-ref --format "%(refname)" | sed 's/^refs\///g'


Output Directory Format
=======================

Each version will be built into a seperate subdirectory of the Sphinx output directory.
The ``smv_outputdir_format`` setting determines the directory structure for the subdirectories. It is a new-style Python formatting string with two parameters - ``ref`` and ``config``.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.name}'        # Use the branch/tag name
    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.commit}'      # Use the commit hash
    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.commit:.7s}'  # Use the commit hash truncated to 7 characters
    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.refname}'     # Use the full refname
    smv_outputdir_format = '{ref.source}/{ref.name}'      # Equivalent to the previous example
    smv_outputdir_format = 'versions/{config.release}'    # Use "versions" as parent directory and the "release" variable from conf.py
    smv_outputdir_format = '{config.version}/{ref.name}'  # Use the version from conf.py as parent directory and the branch/tag name as subdirectory
